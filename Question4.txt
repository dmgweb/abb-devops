4. Networking -Explain how you try to inspect the error in the next case:
We have a remote user who has an edge machine connected on a VPN with network (192.168.2.0/23)
using 4G connection with public ip 89.32.42.4. And another interface connected to the factory net-
work 10.2.3.0/32 . They added one robot and one database sink. The robot is on the factory network
and the database and the monitoring tool is running on a docker stack the. The user says that he
added the ip and the database hostname, but the monitoring tool is not storing any data. You have
access to the VPN and the edge has the port 22 open and you know the user (username: support)
and password to access

1. Who you connect to the edge

a. what ip range: ??? I think that when you indicate 10.2.3.0/32 as the network address, it should be a host address for the /32
b. what protocol you should use to connect: SSH
c. write the linux command or the connection string for this protocol: ssh support@89.32.42.4 


2. Write 3 different things you should check
Docker logs to see that the service started and does not give unexpected errors.
Ports are open on the firewall? I would check with telnet to 3306 or 5432 if use mysql or postgresql
traceroute to chek all jumps in network


3. Write 5 different error that should happened
Where has the user added the ip and the hostname? in private dns? file host? The services may not resolve the same as the local computer.
Does the database user have write permissions?
Has the variables file in docker-compose for the connections been checked?
The default route can prevent traffic from flowing through the vpn tunnel interface
